    Car Sequencing with Paint-Shop Batching Constraints

    In this problem, a sequence of cars (each belonging to a certain class) must be arranged.
    Each class is characterized by:
      - A color (an integer value).
      - A set of option requirements (a Boolean list for each option).

    The instance data includes:
      - nb_positions: number of cars (positions in the sequence)
      - nb_options: number of options
      - nb_classes: number of classes
      - paint_batch_limit: maximum number of consecutive cars without a paint change
      - objective_order: a code indicating the lexicographic order of objectives
      - start_position: positions before this value must remain fixed
      - For each option: max_cars_per_window (maximum allowed cars with that option in any window), window_size, and a flag indicating if the option is high priority.
      - For each class: color (an integer), number of cars in the class, and for each option a binary indicator (1 if the option is required, 0 otherwise).
      - initial_sequence: a list of length nb_positions giving the initial production plan (each entry is a class index).

    Candidate Solution:
      A permutation (list) of integers of length nb_positions that rearranges the initial production plan.
      Positions before start_position must remain fixed.
      
    Objective:
      Three objectives are computed:
        - objective_color: the total number of color changes between consecutive cars (from start_position onward).
        - objective_high_priority: total violations over all high-priority options (for each window, the excess over the allowed maximum).
        - objective_low_priority: similar violation count for low-priority options.
      The overall objective is then combined lexicographically according to the specified objective_order.

        Evaluate a candidate solution.

        The candidate solution should be a permutation (list) of integers of length nb_positions.
        It represents indices into the initial production plan.

        First, verify that positions before start_position remain fixed (i.e. candidate[p] == p for p < start_position).

        Then, reconstruct the production sequence:
           sequence[p] = initial_sequence[ solution[p] ]

        Compute three objectives:
          - objective_color: Sum over positions p = start_position-1 to nb_positions-2 of a 1 if
            the color (from color_class) changes between consecutive positions.

              to nb_positions - window_size[o] + 1), count the number of cars (according to their class's requirement in options_data)
              that require option o. If the count exceeds max_cars_per_window[o], add the excess as a violation.
            Sum violations over all windows for high-priority options to get objective_high_priority, and similarly for low-priority options to get objective_low_priority.
          - Finally, combine the three objectives lexicographically according to objective_order.
